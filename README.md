# buffme
BuffMe is a GUI-based, controller-driven buff dispatcher for Project Lazarus. Players can /tell your driver “buff me” to receive a predefined list of buffs from your group. Uses persistent spell lookup, short-lived agents, and auto-detects E3Next or EQBC. Designed to be lightweight and Lazarus-safe.
